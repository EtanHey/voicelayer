# Update gate contract, version 1

Status: schema and transition semantics only. Runtime admissions, persistent storage,
cross-process locking, installation and recovery are not connected.

`src/update-gate.ts` exports the Zod state, command, acknowledgement and lease schemas,
their inferred types, `readUpdateGate` and `transitionUpdateGate`.
Wire keys and enum values are case-sensitive. Extra fields and incompatible versions
are rejected. Missing, malformed or unreadable state must be passed as unknown input;
it yields `UNKNOWN`, which refuses all transitions. There is no idle fallback or
automatic initialization. A future verified bootstrap supplies the initial OPEN
record with generation 0 and released null.

Every lease binds a positive safe-integer generation, UUID operation ID, UUID owner
incarnation and lowercase full target merge SHA. The owner ID is retained across a
job reconnect, but a new owner incarnation cannot assume the previous owner's lease.
An ID is a fencing identity, not authentication, proof of process liveness or a PID.

OPEN alone permits admission. DRAINING, PREPARED and COMMITTED all close admission.
REQUEST advances exactly one generation from OPEN. An identical duplicate request
returns UNCHANGED even after preparation or commit. PREPARE needs native and daemon
acknowledgements for that exact lease, with zero active operations and archive writes.
COMMIT applies once from PREPARED; a duplicate returns UNCHANGED. Callers perform
mutation only after durably persisting an APPLIED commit, never for UNCHANGED.
CANCEL reopens only the matching precommit generation. Its duplicate is idempotent;
the released request cannot acquire that generation again. COMMITTED cannot reopen
in this slice. Verified completion and recovery belong to later adapters.

Adapters must read the authoritative state, obtain current participant evidence,
transition, and durably persist the result within the same cross-process critical
section used by admissions. The pure function does not serialize two snapshots.
Only a trusted owner may submit commands; adapters validate participant process
identities, current readiness and staged target verification. Persisted preparation
does not prove readiness after an app or daemon restart: reconcile participants
before commit. An absent owner or expired heartbeat never opens the gate.

Tests exercise ordered contenders, fencing, duplicate commands, malformed evidence
and serialization round trips. They do not qualify Swift/Bun locking or installed
runtime safety. Those remain release blockers until the later slices are verified.
